My explanation of how the api works

1. Information is submitted either to GET, POST (cretae new information), PUT (update information), or DELETE via the next request.  In this example is it done on post where the post
    app targets the specific webpage (e.g. localhost:3000/api/users)
    a. the next request just gathers the data that is sent via json
2. zod (library) via the schema.ts file validates the informatoin being sent by the user in the next request to ensure that the data is correct
    a. e.g. like the email is formatted correctly, the name is the min or max legnth etc. 
3. Primsma actually fetches/pushes the data to and from the database.  This database connetion was setup in teh prism folder as well as the 
    database connection string in the .env file.
